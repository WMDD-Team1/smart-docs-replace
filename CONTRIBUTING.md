## Branch Strategy

- `main`: production branch
- `dev`: integration branch
- `feature/<feature-name>`: individual feature development

## Commit Messages

- `feat`: new feature

- `chore`: configuration, documentation, build related
- `refactor`: code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: adding or modifying tests
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `perf`: performance improvements

## File Naming

### Frontend

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `InvoiceCard.jsx`)

## Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Avoid inline styles unless necessary
- Maintain consistency in spacing, typography, and colors according to design guidelines

## Code Style

- ESLint + Prettier enforced

## Pull Request

- Split PRs by feature.
- Team members create PRs to the `dev` branch.
- Team lead reviews and approves PRs before merging.
- Merge only after tests pass.

## Testing
